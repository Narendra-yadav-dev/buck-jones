      <h2>SUPPORT</h2>
      <p>I will continuously update this support area with answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), the latest
        technology news, and links to development and technology sites. We appreciate comments, suggestions, and/or
        corrections for this page.</p>
      <h1 class="faq_class">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <input type="checkbox" class="acc-check" name="accordion" id="q1">
          <label for="q1" class="faq-title">
            <span>What do I need to get my website up and running?</span>
            <span class="icon"></span>
          </label>
          <div class="content">
            <p>First, you need to register a domain name, for example, yourcompany.com. You can purchase and register
              your domain name through many different companies, such as register.com or godaddy.com. Alternatively, you
              can also call us, and we can assist you with the process. When you use our service, you have access to a
              live representative when you call on the phone.</p>
            <p>Second, unless you have your own web server, you will also need a web hosting account. Depending on your
              needs, there are various types of hosting accounts available. Usually, a shared hosting account will
              suffice, and they typically range in price from $ 5 to $ 12 per month. In some instances, a company may
              want to purchase a dedicated server account, which typically costs between $45.00 and $150.00 per month. A
              dedicated server offers significantly more flexibility in terms of running your own software and
              application servers. We have hosting as low as $80.00 a year</p>
            <p>Finally, you'll need the website itself, which consists of all the files, images, and other resources
              your site may require. Several web technologies are available for building a website, ranging from basic
              HTML and CSS to ASP.NET, PHP, ColdFusion, Flash, Java EE, and JavaScript.</p>

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <input type="checkbox" class="acc-check" name="accordion" id="q2">
          <label for="q2" class="faq-title">
            <span>Can't I just build my own website?</span>
            <span class="icon"></span>
          </label>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The answer to this question is: you can. If you have the time, want to learn, and have limited financial
              resources, you can build your own site. If you just need an online business card and have the time and
              inclination, there are many WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) applications available for building
              websites. You can also purchase a template and "fill it in" yourself. The problem with this approach is
              that if you have little or no experience with HTML, CSS, and dynamic web content, it can end up costing
              you more in frustration, time, and resources than it would to have it done professionally. This is where I
              come in to save the day!</p>

        <div class="accordion-item">

            <span>

              Should I buy a template or have a custom site built?
            </span>
            <span class="icon"></span>
          </label>
          <div class="content">
            <p>We have links to template sites you can check out. If you have a template/layout you like, please let us
              know, and we'll check the price. Often, we can duplicate the layout and save you some money. Sometimes,
              buying a template can save a ton of time, and as we all know, Time is money. However, it ultimately
              depends on your specific needs. If you need dynamic data content, it sometimes makes more sense to build a
              custom site. Sometimes, a template will lay the groundwork for you and save you or your professional a
              significant amount of time.</p>

          </label>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Again, this depends on the function of your website. Other factors include whether you already have
              content available, such as a logo, images, copy (text-based information), and data, including databases or
              XML files. We work closely with our clients to ensure their site is up and running as soon as possible.

            <p>Depending on your needs, we'll build your site with the web technology that's right for you.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>All of today's web technologies, such as ASP.NET and PHP, can get the job done. Factors such as budget,
              existing resources, integration with other systems, flexibility, and future business plans can influence
              this decision. That being said, if you're just starting out, we generally recommend using PHP or ASP.NET.
              Invariably, almost all web hosting companies with shared hosting plans provide support.</p>

              WE manage larger projects and do some of the programming ourselves. I have connections to people who work
